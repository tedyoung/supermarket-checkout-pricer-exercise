# The Supermarket Checkout Pricer

The aim of the exercise is to build the pricing portion of a self-service checkout machine.
This exercise focuses mostly on the pure Domain, but you can also try structuring it according to Hexagonal Architecture for the "receipt printing" feature. 

The supermarket has a catalog with different types of products (rice, apples, milk, toothbrushes,...).
Each product has a price, and the total price of the shopping cart is the total of all the prices.

The supermarket runs special deals, such as:
 - Buy two toothbrushes, get one half-off
 - 10% discount on rice
 - Bags of 1 kg of oranges $4 instead of $5.
 - and so on

These are just examples: the actual special deals changes each week, so needs to be easily configurable.

## Getting Started

A story to start with is:

      Given a toothbrush product that has a price of $1
      When toothbrush is added to the cart
      Then querying cart's total price returns $1.00

And you can follow up with:

      Given toothbrush with price of $1
      And there is a deal: buy two toothbrushes get one half-off
      When two toothbrushes are added to the cart
      Then querying cart's total price returns $1.50


### TDD Hints

Start with the test, of course.

Think about a "baseline" test: what is the cart's total price when it's empty?

Then when adding one product.

Then when adding multiple products.

This path follows the ZOM in the ZOMbie acronym: **Z**ero, **O**ne, **M**any/**M**ore complex (while considering **B**oundaries, **I**nterfaces, and **E**xceptional cases).

### Hexagonal Architecture Hints

When handling a "receipt printing" story, think about where that might go.

In Hexagonal Architecture, all I/O goes into a separate class and package (e.g., `adapter.out.console.receipt.ReceiptPrinter`), while keeping the Domain "pure" in its own package (e.g., `domain.Cart`).

#### Details

Product "add" information comes in to our system as Product Name and Price.
Upon add, we display the receipt to the external ReceiptDisplay system.

## More Scenarios

The goal of the exercise is to implement pricing code in the cart that can handle different scenarios, such as the following:

 - The client should get a receipt with the list of products and the total price
 - The code should be able to handle the following scenarios:
    - Buy 2 of the same item, get one 50% off
    - Buy 3 of the same item, get one free
    - 10% discount on certain products: 10% discount on 1kg packets of rice
    - Buy 3 items in a single category (e.g., produce, i.e., fruits and vegetables) and get 
    - Fixed $ discounts (e.g., bag of 1kg of oranges costs $4 instead of $5)
    - Discounts based on day of the week (e.g., Friday Special: sourdough bread 30% off)
 
 - It should be able to handle combinations of the above scenarios, when there is more than one special deal in the shopping cart items.
