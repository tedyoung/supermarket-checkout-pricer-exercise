# The Supermarket Checkout Pricer

The aim of the exercise is to build the pricing portion of a self-service checkout machine.
This exercise focuses mostly on the pure Domain, but you can also try structuring it according to Hexagonal Architecture for the "receipt printing" feature. 

The supermarket has a catalog with different types of products (rice, apples, milk, toothbrushes,...).
Each product has a price, and the total price of the shopping cart is the total of all the prices.

The supermarket runs special deals, such as:
 - Buy two of the same item (e.g., 2 toothbrushes), get one half-off
 - 10% discount on rice
 - Bags of 1 kg of oranges $4 instead of $5.
 - Single day specials (only good on Friday) or during specific time (3pm-5pm Mon-Fri). 
 - and so on

These are just examples: the actual special deals changes each week, so needs to be easily configurable.

## Getting Started

A story to start with is:

      Given a toothbrush product that has a price of $1
      When a toothbrush is added to the cart
      Then querying cart's total price returns $1.00

And you can follow up with:

      Given toothbrush with price of $1
      And there is a deal: buy two toothbrushes get one half-off
      When two toothbrushes are added to the cart
      Then querying cart's total price returns $1.50


### TDD Path

Start with the test, of course, i.e., a test method in the `CartTest` class.
Let the production code class be created by a test that doesn't compile.

Think about a "baseline" test: what is the cart's total price when it's empty?

Then when adding one product?

Then when adding multiple products?
Two of the same product?
Two different products?

This path follows the ZOM in the ZOMbie acronym: **Z**ero, **O**ne, **M**any/**M**ore complex (while considering **B**oundaries, **I**nterfaces, and **E**xceptional cases).

### Hexagonal Architecture Path

It might make more sense to *start* with a Hexagonal Architecture, and do this exercise "outside-in".
Consider: how does the system know which `Product` was added to the `Cart`?


When handling a "receipt printing" story, think about where that might go.
Remember that in Hexagonal Architecture, all I/O goes into a separate class and package (e.g., `adapter.out.console.receipt.ReceiptPrinter`), while keeping the Domain "pure" in its own package (e.g., `domain.Cart`).

## More Scenarios

The goal of the exercise is to implement pricing code in the cart that can handle different scenarios, such as the following:

 - The client should get a receipt with the list of products and the total price
 - The code should be able to handle the following scenarios:
    - Buy 2 of the same item, get one 50% off
    - Buy 3 of the same item, get one free
    - 10% discount on certain products: 10% discount on 1kg packets of rice
    - Buy 3 items in a single category (e.g., produce, i.e., fruits and vegetables) and get 
    - Fixed $ discounts (e.g., bag of 1kg of oranges costs $4 instead of $5)
    - Discounts based on day of the week (e.g., Friday Special: sourdough bread 30% off)
 
 - It should be able to handle combinations of the above scenarios, when there is more than one special deal in the shopping cart items.
